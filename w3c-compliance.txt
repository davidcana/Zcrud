W3C compliance report
---------------------

One of the main goals of zCrud is to generate w3c compliant HTML code. There are some issues about this:

* list.html: 
    - Info: A table row was 3 columns wide, which is less than the column count established by the first row (5).
      This warning is due to the data-trepeat tag. Nowadays there is no solution for this, it is a problem related to the template engine (ZPT-JS).
      
* form.html:
    Everything OK!
